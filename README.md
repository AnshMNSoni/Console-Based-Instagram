# Console-Based-Instagram 🔥

#### 👉 Welcome to my first `Dart` project! This is a console-based version of Instagram, where users can create a profile, follow other users, and view their own profile. It was built with a focus on handling edge cases and user input validation.

<hr/>

### Features 🚀
#### 👉 Fresh Login Experience:

- Initially, only the "Create Profile" section is available.
- After creating a profile, users can access the "Search Profile" and "Your Profile" sections.

<hr/>

#### 👉 Create Profile:

- Includes fields like profile name, email, password, and date of birth (DOB).
- Handles errors like strings in place of numbers, ensuring smooth user input handling.

<hr/>

#### 👉 Follow Profiles:

- You can follow someone.
- Once someone is followed, you can no longer follow them again.

<hr/>

#### 👉 Limitations ⚠️
- Users can create only one account.
- The messaging functionality is not included.

<hr/>

#### 👉 Technologies Used 🛠️
- Dart: A programming language used to build this console-based application.

#### 👉 Setup Instructions 💻
- Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/console-based-instagram.git`

#### 👉 How to Use 🖥️
- On first run, create a new profile with the required information:

1️⃣ Profile Name <br/>
