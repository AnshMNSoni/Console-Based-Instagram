# Console-Based-Instagram

👉 Welcome to my first `Dart` project! This is a console-based version of Instagram, where users can create a profile, follow other users, and view their own profile. It was built with a focus on handling edge cases and user input validation.

### Features 🚀

- Initially, only the "Create Profile" section is available.
- After creating a profile, users can access the "Search Profile" and "Your Profile" sections.

#### 👉 Create Profile:

- Includes fields like profile name, email, password, and date of birth (DOB).
- Handles errors like strings in place of numbers, ensuring smooth user input handling.
