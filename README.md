# Console-Based-Instagram

Welcome to my first Dart project! This is a console-based version of Instagram, where users can create a profile, follow other users, and view their own profile. It was built with a focus on handling edge cases and user input validation.

Features 🚀
Fresh Login Experience:

Initially, only the "Create Profile" section is available.
After creating a profile, users can access the "Search Profile" and "Your Profile" sections.
Create Profile:

Includes fields like profile name, email, password, and date of birth (DOB).
Handles errors like strings in place of numbers, ensuring smooth user input handling.
Follow Profiles:

You can follow someone.
Once someone is followed, you can no longer follow them again.
Limitations ⚠️
Users can create only one account.
The messaging functionality is not included.
